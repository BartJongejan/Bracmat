project.bra		(From version 3.47) A tool to initialise a new Bracmat program
				Usage: Read this file ( get'"project.bra" ) and answer the
				questions. The created program stub has a comment, a class
				for the program and a reread procedure that reads the file,
				renames the file to a backup and saves it, thereby nicely
				reformatting the code. (Most comments are lost!) Some editors
				discover that the file has been changed and propose to reread
				the file. In this way, the user doesn't need to bother about
				formatting. Cyclus: edit program, save from editor, reread in
				Bracmat, reload in editor, edit program.
