        -:  124:
        -:  125:    19 September 2012
        -:  126:Made major changes in Naamwoord, Naamwoord_w and doPosition to make two levels
        -:  127:of indirection work also in the case that an object is at the first level.
        -:  128:Handling of two levels of indirection is improved generally.

        -:  130:    16 September 2012
        -:  131:Using gcov, found some places that are unreachable in merge(), substdiff() and

        -:  139:    22 August 2012
        -:  140:Bug removed. The expression

        -:  142:    : ?G1
        -:  143:    : (=(A&X:?(G1.)) B)

        -:  145:would not match the 'B' in the pattern with anything valid, because the 
        -:  146:assignment X:?(G1.) had deleted the original subject. Now the subject is
        -:  147:temporarily reference-incremented, so the 'B' still matches the old value of
        -:  148:G1. The expression as a whole evaluates to X. Notice that this bug did not
        -:  149:affect the very similar
        -:  150:    ( (G2==A B)
        -:  151:    & !G2
        -:  152:    : (=(A&X:?(G2.)) B)
        -:  153:    )
        -:  154:Reason: here, the subject is not the object that G1 is bound to, but a copy.
        -:  155:And that is so because the object that G1 is bound to is headed by an
        -:  156:unevaluated = (being part of the rhs of an = operator). The expression !G2,
        -:  157:however, must be evaluated, so it cannot be identical to G2's value.
        -:  158:Consequently, the reassignment of G2 does not affect the subject of the
        -:  159:pattern match operation, which is (=A B) at all times.
        -:  160:
        -:  161:     4 August 2012

        -:  164:    31 July 2012
        -:  165:Made code gcc -pedantic proof. There are two string constants with a length
        -:  166:greater than 509, which ISO C89 compilers are required to support. Therefore
        -:  167:the option -std=c99 is added.

        -:  177:Changes in bmalloc that makes it possible to compile with -O3.
        -:  178:Changed 'unsigned char' to 'char' in a lot of places to make some
        -:  179:warnings go away when compiled with gcc.

        -:  181:    22 June 2012

        -:  183:Correction in scompare(). The expression @(1b:~<1 b) did not evaluate 
        -:  184:successfully, which it should. Did a clean-up of this function.

        -:  264:The previous change moved the scanning pointer to the point in the subject
        -:  265:where the rhs pattern starts. The current change moves the end of the

        -:  267:pattern with last characters of the subject. Of course, this is only possible
        -:  268:if the final zero byte has not been reached. The calling instance of
        -:  269:stringmatch defines the end of the subject for the called instance. The called
        -:  270:instance can propose to move the end. In this way, scanning can move much
        -:  271:faster if a patterns contains some fixed strings. Speed-up does not work for

        -:  279:the first mismatch.
        -:  280:
        -:  281:This changes the behaviour of some patterns, such as in
        -:  282:@(abXk:(|? b|`) X ?id)
        -:  283:Before, the match failed, because the 'b' in the pattern did not match the

        -:  285:the pattern matcher not even tries to match 'a' and 'b' and so the expression
        -:  286:succeeds. In many cases the (|? b|`) pattern works as before, though:

        -:  316:
        -:  317:Made stringmatch 'greedy' to an extend that does not change the program's
        -:  318:behaviour. (That is: all tests in valid.bra go through). Many string
        -:  319:comparisons now continue past the cutoff position deviding the subject in a

        -:  325:
        -:  326:The normal (non-string) match is not optimized. It is questionable whether that
        -:  327:would be worthwhile. Not many patterns require repeated elongation of the part
        -:  328:of the subject left of the division point.
        -:  329:

        -:  338:    16 December 2011
        -:  339:
        -:  340:Repaired two bugs in doPosition. The first bug made the FENCE flag disappear
        -:  341:from the result if the program was built in debug mode in VS2008, which made
        -:  342:the program run as expected, the other bug was that the FENCE flag was

        -:  377:    3 November 2011
        -:  378:

        -:  384:Made better sense of [<> (equivalent to [~) and [~<> (equivalent to [).
        -:  385:Introduced [% prefix. The expression reigned by [% in a pattern is evaluated.
        -:  386:The success or failure of the expression is the result of the match.
        -:  387:This functionality is similar to patterns that are function calls: in both

        -:  394:
        -:  395:Changed signature of find, getmember, naamwoord and naamwoord_w. Before, these
        -:  396:functions returned TRUE or FALSE, while the binding was returned in a
        -:  397:pointer-to-a-pointer. The program is a bit quicker (approx. 5%).

        -:  432:
        -:  433:If the rhs is an atomic node with a non-empty string, the rhs can only match
        -:  434:atomic subjects with the same string. (But possibly with flags that are not

        -:  438:
        -:  439:The use of $ as "escape operator" is now taken one step further. One can now
        -:  440:use $ to escape any operator in a pattern, so that the otherwise problematic
        -:  441:operators = | & : ' $ _ can be pacified and parsed.
        -:  442:
        -:  443:   23 August 2011
        -:  444:Inside macros the $ can be used as escape operator to insert a $ with empty
        -:  445:lhs in the evaluated macro. Also, the _ operator is from now on left untouched
        -:  446:in a macro unless escaped. This made it necessary to adapt a few bracmat

        -:  454:
        -:  455:   26 July 2011
        -:  456:There was a problem with the ! and !! flags in connection with the flg

        -:  460:
        -:  461:   29 June 2011
        -:  462:Changed a few ints to long to get rid of type casts.

        -:  497:Arithmetic more complex than adding is now done with much higher radix.
        -:  498:For small numbers compuations are a little bit slower, because of conversions

        -:  509:    21 February 2011
        -:  510:Rewrite of bmalloc, bfree and initialization of memory. Memory now expands

        -:  516:    11 January 2011
        -:  517:The @ is again removed from non-nil atoms. Reason: the @ flag is used on a 
        -:  518:non-nil atom to indicate that backslashes in the atomstring must be

        -:  532:In stringmatch, the % can be used to force characterwise matching if the

        -:  544:    15 November 2010
        -:  545:Evaluation of sums and products is now iterative instead of recursive.
        -:  546:Also, two sums or products are neatly merged instead of appended and thereafter

        -:  548:and no danger of stack overflow.
        -:  549:For short sums, the implementation has become a little bit slower, because

        -:  552:
        -:  553:    8 November 2010
        -:  554:Made some minor changes such as int -> size_t.
        -:  555:Most radical change is introduction of function Entry2 which is like Entry,

        -:  571:In bmalloc, all bytes are set to 0, not just the last one.
        -:  572:Reason: if all elements of size X are in use, bmalloc may return

        -: 1099:NOTES
        -: 1100:=====
        -: 1101:
        -: 1102:2002.12.15
        -: 1103:----------
        -: 1104:This is the open source version of Bracmat.
        -: 1105:
        -: 1106:Originally, Bracmat was written in Basic for the Amstrad computer. Its sole
        -: 1107:purpose was to derive a simple expression for the curvature of a model
        -: 1108:space-time, starting from the components of the metric. The only operations
        -: 1109:the program was capable to perform were multiplications, exponentiations,
        -: 1110:logarithms, and partial derivatives. The expressions were a mix of numbers
        -: 1111:and symbolic variables, like "a+2*b". Thus, "a+a" was simplified to "2*a".
        -: 1112:
        -: 1113:The second version of Bracmat, about 1988, was developed in Ansi C and run
        -: 1114:on an Acorn Archimedes. Great care was taken to make the program portable to
        -: 1115:other hardware, such as Atari, VAX and even the PC. The PC architecture, with
        -: 1116:its limited memory, its 16 bit architecture and its limitation on the size of
        -: 1117:the program stack, posed some severe limitations on the program. Therefore
        -: 1118:great care was taken to limit the use of the stack to a minimum. This has
        -: 1119:lead to some rather large functions (to save stack-consuming function calls).
        -: 1120:
        -: 1121:The C version became a true programnming language, with program variables,
        -: 1122:logical operators and function calls. The syntax, however, was not changed.
        -: 1123:For example, instead of using "if...then...else...", I decided to write
        -: 1124:something like "...&...|...", using lazy evaluation of the infix binary
        -: 1125:logical operators "&" (AND) and "|" (OR) for program control.
        -: 1126:
        -: 1127:The logical operators, of course, should test for operands being "true" or
        -: 1128:"false". The main provider of interesting truth values became the pattern
        -: 1129:matching operator ":", which tests whether the pattern (the rhs-operand)
        -: 1130:matches the subject (the lhs-operand). The single outstanding feature of
        -: 1131:Bracmat is, in fact, its pattern recognition, which works on tree structures,
        -: 1132:not on strings of characters.
        -: 1133:
        -: 1134:Bracmat was also extended with a few operators that makes this programming
        -: 1135:language interesting in the field of computational linguistics, namely the
        -: 1136:blank " ", the comma "," and the full stop ".". (The interpunction symbols
        -: 1137:"?", "!" and ";" were already 'taken' to serve other purposes.)

        -: 1139:You may find the source code difficult to read at some places. You are best
        -: 1140:off if you understand English and Dutch (and perhaps Danish). Only if the
