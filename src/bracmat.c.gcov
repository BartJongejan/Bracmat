        -:  124:of indirection work also in the case that an object is at the first level.
        -:  125:Handling of two levels of indirection is improved generally.
        -:  126:
        -:  127:    16 September 2012
        -:  128:Using gcov, found some places that are unreachable in merge(), substdiff() and

        -:  140:    : (=(A&X:?(G1.)) B)
        -:  141:    )
        -:  142:would not match the 'B' in the pattern with anything valid, because the 
        -:  143:assignment X:?(G1.) had deleted the original subject. Now the subject is
        -:  144:temporarily reference-incremented, so the 'B' still matches the old value of
        -:  145:G1. The expression as a whole evaluates to X. Notice that this bug did not
        -:  146:affect the very similar
        -:  147:    ( (G2==A B)
        -:  148:    & !G2

        -:  151:Reason: here, the subject is not the object that G1 is bound to, but a copy.
        -:  152:And that is so because the object that G1 is bound to is headed by an
        -:  153:unevaluated = (being part of the rhs of an = operator). The expression !G2,
        -:  154:however, must be evaluated, so it cannot be identical to G2's value.
        -:  155:Consequently, the reassignment of G2 does not affect the subject of the

        -:  174:Changes in bmalloc that makes it possible to compile with -O3.
        -:  175:Changed 'unsigned char' to 'char' in a lot of places to make some
        -:  176:warnings go away when compiled with gcc.

        -:  187:    2 June 2012
        -:  188:

        -:  233:    4 February 2012
        -:  234:

        -:  261:The previous change moved the scanning pointer to the point in the subject
        -:  262:where the rhs pattern starts. The current change moves the end of the

        -:  264:pattern with last characters of the subject. Of course, this is only possible
        -:  265:if the final zero byte has not been reached. The calling instance of
        -:  266:stringmatch defines the end of the subject for the called instance. The called
        -:  267:instance can propose to move the end. In this way, scanning can move much
        -:  268:faster if a patterns contains some fixed strings. Speed-up does not work for
        -:  269:alternations of fixed srings. Speed-up only works for the first pattern

        -:  276:the first mismatch.
        -:  277:
        -:  278:This changes the behaviour of some patterns, such as in
        -:  279:@(abXk:(|? b|`) X ?id)
        -:  280:Before, the match failed, because the 'b' in the pattern did not match the
        -:  281:'a' in the subject. Now, nowing that the first X occurs in the third position,
        -:  282:the pattern matcher not even tries to match 'a' and 'b' and so the expression
        -:  283:succeeds. In many cases the (|? b|`) pattern works as before, though:
        -:  284:@(abXk:(|? b|`) (X|Y) ?id)

        -:  295:Compiled 64 bit version with VS 2008. Had to use _WIN64 and some #defines,

        -:  313:
        -:  314:Made stringmatch 'greedy' to an extend that does not change the program's
        -:  315:behaviour. (That is: all tests in valid.bra go through). Many string
        -:  316:comparisons now continue past the cutoff position deviding the subject in a
        -:  317:lhs and a rhs, pushing the division point to the position where the lhs
        -:  318:patterns succeeds. Previously this point repeatedly was moved one byte until
        -:  319:the lhs pattern either succeeded or definitely failed. The optimization is
        -:  320:turned off for alternating patterns and for all but the first pattern in a

        -:  322:
        -:  323:The normal (non-string) match is not optimized. It is questionable whether that
        -:  324:would be worthwhile. Not many patterns require repeated elongation of the part
        -:  325:of the subject left of the division point.
        -:  326:

        -:  335:    16 December 2011
        -:  336:
        -:  337:Repaired two bugs in doPosition. The first bug made the FENCE flag disappear
        -:  338:from the result if the program was built in debug mode in VS2008, which made
        -:  339:the program run as expected, the other bug was that the FENCE flag was

        -:  374:    3 November 2011
        -:  375:

        -:  381:Made better sense of [<> (equivalent to [~) and [~<> (equivalent to [).
        -:  382:Introduced [% prefix. The expression reigned by [% in a pattern is evaluated.
        -:  383:The success or failure of the expression is the result of the match.
        -:  384:This functionality is similar to patterns that are function calls: in both

        -:  391:
        -:  392:Changed signature of find, getmember, naamwoord and naamwoord_w. Before, these
        -:  393:functions returned TRUE or FALSE, while the binding was returned in a
        -:  394:pointer-to-a-pointer. The program is a bit quicker (approx. 5%).

        -:  424:The escape operator ()$ in patterns can now be used to test for flags on the

        -:  429:
        -:  430:If the rhs is an atomic node with a non-empty string, the rhs can only match
        -:  431:atomic subjects with the same string. (But possibly with flags that are not

        -:  435:
        -:  436:The use of $ as "escape operator" is now taken one step further. One can now
        -:  437:use $ to escape any operator in a pattern, so that the otherwise problematic
        -:  438:operators = | & : ' $ _ can be pacified and parsed.
        -:  439:
        -:  440:   23 August 2011
        -:  441:Inside macros the $ can be used as escape operator to insert a $ with empty
        -:  442:lhs in the evaluated macro. Also, the _ operator is from now on left untouched
        -:  443:in a macro unless escaped. This made it necessary to adapt a few bracmat

        -:  451:
        -:  452:   26 July 2011
        -:  453:There was a problem with the ! and !! flags in connection with the flg

        -:  455:in the result (=!.a) of the evaluation of flg$(=!a), the element ! had the

        -:  457:
        -:  458:   29 June 2011
        -:  459:Changed a few ints to long to get rid of type casts.

        -:  494:Arithmetic more complex than adding is now done with much higher radix.
        -:  495:For small numbers compuations are a little bit slower, because of conversions
        -:  496:to and from character strings. For large numbers, timings are magnitudes

        -:  506:    21 February 2011
        -:  507:Rewrite of bmalloc, bfree and initialization of memory. Memory now expands

        -:  513:    11 January 2011
        -:  514:The @ is again removed from non-nil atoms. Reason: the @ flag is used on a

        -:  529:In stringmatch, the % can be used to force characterwise matching if the

        -:  531:non-nil atoms as superfluous.
        -:  532:One has to take care with minusses: the patterns %"-20/5" and %-20/5 are

        -:  541:    15 November 2010
        -:  542:Evaluation of sums and products is now iterative instead of recursive.
        -:  543:Also, two sums or products are neatly merged instead of appended and thereafter
        -:  544:bubble sorted. Result: much faster processing of very large sums and products
        -:  545:and no danger of stack overflow.
        -:  546:For short sums, the implementation has become a little bit slower, because

        -:  549:
        -:  550:    8 November 2010
        -:  551:Made some minor changes such as int -> size_t.
        -:  552:Most radical change is introduction of function Entry2 which is like Entry,

        -:  568:In bmalloc, all bytes are set to 0, not just the last one.
        -:  569:Reason: if all elements of size X are in use, bmalloc may return

        -: 1096:NOTES
        -: 1097:=====
        -: 1098:
        -: 1099:2002.12.15
        -: 1100:----------
        -: 1101:This is the open source version of Bracmat.
        -: 1102:
        -: 1103:Originally, Bracmat was written in Basic for the Amstrad computer. Its sole
        -: 1104:purpose was to derive a simple expression for the curvature of a model
        -: 1105:space-time, starting from the components of the metric. The only operations
        -: 1106:the program was capable to perform were multiplications, exponentiations,
        -: 1107:logarithms, and partial derivatives. The expressions were a mix of numbers
        -: 1108:and symbolic variables, like "a+2*b". Thus, "a+a" was simplified to "2*a".
        -: 1109:
        -: 1110:The second version of Bracmat, about 1988, was developed in Ansi C and run
        -: 1111:on an Acorn Archimedes. Great care was taken to make the program portable to
        -: 1112:other hardware, such as Atari, VAX and even the PC. The PC architecture, with
        -: 1113:its limited memory, its 16 bit architecture and its limitation on the size of
        -: 1114:the program stack, posed some severe limitations on the program. Therefore
        -: 1115:great care was taken to limit the use of the stack to a minimum. This has
        -: 1116:lead to some rather large functions (to save stack-consuming function calls).
        -: 1117:
        -: 1118:The C version became a true programnming language, with program variables,
        -: 1119:logical operators and function calls. The syntax, however, was not changed.
        -: 1120:For example, instead of using "if...then...else...", I decided to write
        -: 1121:something like "...&...|...", using lazy evaluation of the infix binary
        -: 1122:logical operators "&" (AND) and "|" (OR) for program control.
        -: 1123:
        -: 1124:The logical operators, of course, should test for operands being "true" or
        -: 1125:"false". The main provider of interesting truth values became the pattern
        -: 1126:matching operator ":", which tests whether the pattern (the rhs-operand)
        -: 1127:matches the subject (the lhs-operand). The single outstanding feature of
        -: 1128:Bracmat is, in fact, its pattern recognition, which works on tree structures,
        -: 1129:not on strings of characters.
        -: 1130:
        -: 1131:Bracmat was also extended with a few operators that makes this programming
        -: 1132:language interesting in the field of computational linguistics, namely the
        -: 1133:blank " ", the comma "," and the full stop ".". (The interpunction symbols
        -: 1134:"?", "!" and ";" were already 'taken' to serve other purposes.)
        -: 1135:
        -: 1136:You may find the source code difficult to read at some places. You are best
        -: 1137:off if you understand English and Dutch (and perhaps Danish). Only if the
