        -:  129:Discovered that built in objects too easily were copied. The new function is

        -:  131:new$hash returned ((=).New)'. Now it returns the object node. Changed the rhs

        -:  139:
        -:  140:    19 September 2012
        -:  141:Made major changes in Naamwoord, Naamwoord_w and doPosition to make two levels
        -:  142:of indirection work also in the case that an object is at the first level.
        -:  143:Handling of two levels of indirection is improved generally.
        -:  144:
        -:  145:    16 September 2012
        -:  146:Using gcov, found some places that are unreachable in merge(), substdiff() and

        -:  154:    22 August 2012

        -:  158:    : (=(A&X:?(G1.)) B)
        -:  159:    )
        -:  160:would not match the 'B' in the pattern with anything valid, because the 
        -:  161:assignment X:?(G1.) had deleted the original subject. Now the subject is
        -:  162:temporarily reference-incremented, so the 'B' still matches the old value of
        -:  163:G1. The expression as a whole evaluates to X. Notice that this bug did not
        -:  164:affect the very similar
        -:  165:    ( (G2==A B)
        -:  166:    & !G2

        -:  168:    )
        -:  169:Reason: here, the subject is not the object that G1 is bound to, but a copy.
        -:  170:And that is so because the object that G1 is bound to is headed by an
        -:  171:unevaluated = (being part of the rhs of an = operator). The expression !G2,
        -:  172:however, must be evaluated, so it cannot be identical to G2's value.
        -:  173:Consequently, the reassignment of G2 does not affect the subject of the
        -:  174:pattern match operation, which is (=A B) at all times.
        -:  175:
        -:  176:     4 August 2012

        -:  192:Changes in bmalloc that makes it possible to compile with -O3.
        -:  193:Changed 'unsigned char' to 'char' in a lot of places to make some
        -:  194:warnings go away when compiled with gcc.

        -:  196:    22 June 2012

        -:  313:Compiled 64 bit version with VS 2008. Had to use _WIN64 and some #defines,

        -:  315:Also used the 64 bit versions of ftell and fseek in the VS 2008 case.
        -:  316:
        -:  317:I have these preprocessor defines

        -:  319:

        -:  321:For 64 bit
        -:  322:
        -:  323:Impression is that the 32 bit version should be used unless you have to deal
        -:  324:with enormous data (memory, file) or huge numbers (because numerical
        -:  325:computations are faster and bigger numbers can be factorized quickly using
        -:  326:exponentiation with a fractional exponent).
        -:  327:Otherwise, the 64 bit version is significantly slower and has almost three
        -:  328:times less stack depth.

        -:  330:    2 January 2012
        -:  331:
        -:  332:Made stringmatch 'greedy' to an extend that does not change the program's
        -:  333:behaviour. (That is: all tests in valid.bra go through). Many string
        -:  334:comparisons now continue past the cutoff position deviding the subject in a
        -:  335:lhs and a rhs, pushing the division point to the position where the lhs
        -:  336:patterns succeeds. Previously this point repeatedly was moved one byte until
        -:  337:the lhs pattern either succeeded or definitely failed. The optimization is
        -:  338:turned off for alternating patterns and for all but the first pattern in a

        -:  340:
        -:  341:The normal (non-string) match is not optimized. It is questionable whether that
        -:  342:would be worthwhile. Not many patterns require repeated elongation of the part
        -:  343:of the subject left of the division point.
        -:  344:
        -:  345:However, CUTOFFSUGGEST is set to 0. The overhead does seem to outweigh the

        -:  354:
        -:  355:Repaired two bugs in doPosition. The first bug made the FENCE flag disappear
        -:  356:from the result if the program was built in debug mode in VS2008, which made
        -:  357:the program run as expected, the other bug was that the FENCE flag was

        -:  392:    3 November 2011
        -:  393:

        -:  398:
        -:  399:Made better sense of [<> (equivalent to [~) and [~<> (equivalent to [).
        -:  400:Introduced [% prefix. The expression reigned by [% in a pattern is evaluated.
        -:  401:The success or failure of the expression is the result of the match.
        -:  402:This functionality is similar to patterns that are function calls: in both
        -:  403:cases the current subject is stored in a local variable sjt. In contrast to
        -:  404:the function call, the expression's evaluated value is not itself matched

        -:  406:Contrary to other uses of the % prefix, [% CAN match a nul object.

        -:  408:    1 November 2011
        -:  409:
        -:  410:Changed signature of find, getmember, naamwoord and naamwoord_w. Before, these
        -:  411:functions returned TRUE or FALSE, while the binding was returned in a
        -:  412:pointer-to-a-pointer. The program is a bit quicker (approx. 5%).

        -:  435:    2 September 2011
        -:  436:
        -:  437:Corrected error in evalmacro. Inserted operator nodes where deemed to fail

        -:  441:
        -:  442:The escape operator ()$ in patterns can now be used to test for flags on the
        -:  443:subject. A special case is when the rhs is an empty atom with no flags. This
        -:  444:pattern only matches subjects with no flags. In all other cases, if one or
        -:  445:more flags are present in the rhs, the subject must have these flags as well,
        -:  446:and possibly even more.
        -:  447:
        -:  448:If the rhs is an atomic node with a non-empty string, the rhs can only match
        -:  449:atomic subjects with the same string. (But possibly with flags that are not
        -:  450:specified in the rhs.)

        -:  452:   29 August 2011
        -:  453:
        -:  454:The use of $ as "escape operator" is now taken one step further. One can now
        -:  455:use $ to escape any operator in a pattern, so that the otherwise problematic
        -:  456:operators = | & : ' $ _ can be pacified and parsed.
        -:  457:
        -:  458:   23 August 2011
        -:  459:Inside macros the $ can be used as escape operator to insert a $ with empty
        -:  460:lhs in the evaluated macro. Also, the _ operator is from now on left untouched
        -:  461:in a macro unless escaped. This made it necessary to adapt a few bracmat
        -:  462:scripts, e.g. the cat$ function in this file.

        -:  467:Previously, you had to do this in two steps: flabber=$x & '($flabber)
        -:  468:You also can do this: '('($(=$b))) which evaluates to ='$b
        -:  469:
        -:  470:   26 July 2011
        -:  471:There was a problem with the ! and !! flags in connection with the flg 
        -:  472:function. In flg$(=!a):(=?X.?Z) the assignment to X wouldn't succeed, because
        -:  473:in the result (=!.a) of the evaluation of flg$(=!a), the element ! had the

        -:  475:
        -:  476:   29 June 2011
        -:  477:Changed a few ints to long to get rid of type casts.
        -:  478:
        -:  479:   21 June 2011

        -:  496:    31 March 2011
        -:  497:Stackoverflow occurred if an uninitialised variable was assigned to the

        -:  511:    16 March 2011
        -:  512:Arithmetic more complex than adding is now done with much higher radix.
        -:  513:For small numbers compuations are a little bit slower, because of conversions
        -:  514:to and from character strings. For large numbers, timings are magnitudes

        -:  524:    21 February 2011
        -:  525:Rewrite of bmalloc, bfree and initialization of memory. Memory now expands
        -:  526:dynamically: when a there are no more free memory blocks of 1,2 or 3 (4, 5, 6)
        -:  527:words available, a new pool of memory blocks for the depleted size is created,
        -:  528:doubling the number of blocks in the already allocated pools for that size.
        -:  529:Removed a bug that caused (a=7)&!(a*1) to fail.

        -:  531:    11 January 2011
        -:  532:The @ is again removed from non-nil atoms. Reason: the @ flag is used on a 
        -:  533:non-nil atom to indicate that backslashes in the atomstring must be
        -:  534:interpreted litterally, i.e. @"d:\bracmat" is equivalent to "d:\\bracmat"

        -:  546:    22 November 2010
        -:  547:In stringmatch, the % can be used to force characterwise matching if the
        -:  548:pattern is a number. For that reason, the % and @ are no longer removed from
        -:  549:non-nil atoms as superfluous.
        -:  550:One has to take care with minusses: the patterns %"-20/5" and %-20/5 are

        -:  552:characterwise. In %-20/5, the pattern matches 20/5 and the minus is ignored!
        -:  553:
        -:  554:    19 November 2010
        -:  555:Some tests to check that the position flag is followed by an integer number
        -:  556:and that the flag % doesn't occur.
        -:  557:Made sure that mod$ and div$ fail if second argument is zero.
        -:  558:
        -:  559:    15 November 2010
        -:  560:Evaluation of sums and products is now iterative instead of recursive.
        -:  561:Also, two sums or products are neatly merged instead of appended and thereafter
        -:  562:bubble sorted. Result: much faster processing of very large sums and products
        -:  563:and no danger of stack overflow.
        -:  564:For short sums, the implementation has become a little bit slower, because
        -:  565:I reverted to older, but simpler code that makes more allocations and

        -:  567:
        -:  568:    8 November 2010
        -:  569:Made some minor changes such as int -> size_t.
        -:  570:Most radical change is introduction of function Entry2 which is like Entry,
        -:  571:only with lower level of indirection. Entry2 replaces Entry in three places.
        -:  572:
        -:  573:    3 November 2010
        -:  574:Improved percolation of filter flags < > # / @ %
        -:  575:
        -:  576:    1 November 2010
        -:  577:The built-in function now returns IMPLIEDFENCE if the subject string in
        -:  578:a stringmatch is too long or if it cannot be grown to a valid UTF-8
        -:  579:multibyte sequence. Previously, the FENCE flag was set, but this had
        -:  580:the side effect that utf$ couldn't easily be used as the lhs of a match.
        -:  581:
        -:  582:Change to flt$ : flt$(0,...) now returns 0 instead of failing. Replaced

        -:  586:In bmalloc, all bytes are set to 0, not just the last one.
        -:  587:Reason: if all elements of size X are in use, bmalloc may return
        -:  588:a bigger sized element, of which the last four bytes will not be
        -:  589:used at all. Instead, some earlier bytes must be set to 0.

        -: 1114:NOTES
        -: 1115:=====
        -: 1116:
        -: 1117:2002.12.15
        -: 1118:----------
        -: 1119:This is the open source version of Bracmat.
        -: 1120:
        -: 1121:Originally, Bracmat was written in Basic for the Amstrad computer. Its sole
        -: 1122:purpose was to derive a simple expression for the curvature of a model
        -: 1123:space-time, starting from the components of the metric. The only operations
        -: 1124:the program was capable to perform were multiplications, exponentiations,
        -: 1125:logarithms, and partial derivatives. The expressions were a mix of numbers
        -: 1126:and symbolic variables, like "a+2*b". Thus, "a+a" was simplified to "2*a".
        -: 1127:
        -: 1128:The second version of Bracmat, about 1988, was developed in Ansi C and run
        -: 1129:on an Acorn Archimedes. Great care was taken to make the program portable to
        -: 1130:other hardware, such as Atari, VAX and even the PC. The PC architecture, with
        -: 1131:its limited memory, its 16 bit architecture and its limitation on the size of
        -: 1132:the program stack, posed some severe limitations on the program. Therefore
        -: 1133:great care was taken to limit the use of the stack to a minimum. This has
        -: 1134:lead to some rather large functions (to save stack-consuming function calls).
        -: 1135:
        -: 1136:The C version became a true programnming language, with program variables,
        -: 1137:logical operators and function calls. The syntax, however, was not changed.
        -: 1138:For example, instead of using "if...then...else...", I decided to write
        -: 1139:something like "...&...|...", using lazy evaluation of the infix binary
        -: 1140:logical operators "&" (AND) and "|" (OR) for program control.
        -: 1141:
        -: 1142:The logical operators, of course, should test for operands being "true" or
        -: 1143:"false". The main provider of interesting truth values became the pattern
        -: 1144:matching operator ":", which tests whether the pattern (the rhs-operand)
        -: 1145:matches the subject (the lhs-operand). The single outstanding feature of
        -: 1146:Bracmat is, in fact, its pattern recognition, which works on tree structures,
        -: 1147:not on strings of characters.
        -: 1148:
        -: 1149:Bracmat was also extended with a few operators that makes this programming
        -: 1150:language interesting in the field of computational linguistics, namely the
        -: 1151:blank " ", the comma "," and the full stop ".". (The interpunction symbols
        -: 1152:"?", "!" and ";" were already 'taken' to serve other purposes.)

        -: 1154:You may find the source code difficult to read at some places. You are best
        -: 1155:off if you understand English and Dutch (and perhaps Danish). Only if the
