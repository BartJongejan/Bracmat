        -:  147:    : (=(A&X:?(G1.)) B)

        -:  151:temporarily reference-incremented, so the 'B' still matches the old value of
        -:  152:G1. The expression as a whole evaluates to X. Notice that this bug did not
        -:  153:affect the very similar
        -:  154:    ( (G2==A B)
        -:  155:    & !G2

        -:  158:Reason: here, the subject is not the object that G1 is bound to, but a copy.
        -:  159:And that is so because the object that G1 is bound to is headed by an
        -:  160:unevaluated = (being part of the rhs of an = operator). The expression !G2,
        -:  161:however, must be evaluated, so it cannot be identical to G2's value.
        -:  162:Consequently, the reassignment of G2 does not affect the subject of the
        -:  163:pattern match operation, which is (=A B) at all times.
        -:  164:
        -:  165:     4 August 2012

        -:  168:    31 July 2012
        -:  169:Made code gcc -pedantic proof. There are two string constants with a length
        -:  170:greater than 509, which ISO C89 compilers are required to support. Therefore
        -:  171:the option -std=c99 is added.

        -:  181:Changes in bmalloc that makes it possible to compile with -O3.
        -:  182:Changed 'unsigned char' to 'char' in a lot of places to make some
        -:  183:warnings go away when compiled with gcc.

        -:  185:    22 June 2012
        -:  186:
        -:  187:Correction in scompare(). The expression @(1b:~<1 b) did not evaluate 
        -:  188:successfully, which it should. Did a clean-up of this function.

        -:  230:   23 February 2012
        -:  231:
        -:  232:When Bracmat reads a file that is not well-formed, it asks fo a file name where

        -:  240:    4 February 2012

        -:  245:(1a.)+(10.)+(2.) -> (1a.)+(2.)+(10.)
        -:  246:Thus the order of (10.) and (1a.) depends on other terms.
        -:  247:Now the rule is: 
        -:  248:1) any number is smaller than any non-number
        -:  249:2) numbers are compared numerically
        -:  250:3) non-numbers are compared with strcmp

        -:  252:    25 January 2012
        -:  253:
        -:  254:Improved handling of negative positions (positions counted from the end)

        -:  266:    20 January 2012
        -:  267:
        -:  268:The previous change moved the scanning pointer to the point in the subject
        -:  269:where the rhs pattern starts. The current change moves the end of the
        -:  270:subject as far as necessary to the right to allow a full match of the rhs
        -:  271:pattern with last characters of the subject. Of course, this is only possible
        -:  272:if the final zero byte has not been reached. The calling instance of
        -:  273:stringmatch defines the end of the subject for the called instance. The called
        -:  274:instance can propose to move the end. In this way, scanning can move much
        -:  275:faster if a patterns contains some fixed strings. Speed-up does not work for
        -:  276:alternations of fixed srings. Speed-up only works for the first pattern

        -:  283:the first mismatch.
        -:  284:
        -:  285:This changes the behaviour of some patterns, such as in
        -:  286:@(abXk:(|? b|`) X ?id)
        -:  287:Before, the match failed, because the 'b' in the pattern did not match the
        -:  288:'a' in the subject. Now, nowing that the first X occurs in the third position,
        -:  289:the pattern matcher not even tries to match 'a' and 'b' and so the expression
        -:  290:succeeds. In many cases the (|? b|`) pattern works as before, though:

        -:  343:

        -:  345:from the result if the program was built in debug mode in VS2008, which made

        -:  388:Made better sense of [<> (equivalent to [~) and [~<> (equivalent to [).
        -:  389:Introduced [% prefix. The expression reigned by [% in a pattern is evaluated.
        -:  390:The success or failure of the expression is the result of the match.
        -:  391:This functionality is similar to patterns that are function calls: in both

        -:  398:

        -:  442:
        -:  443:The use of $ as "escape operator" is now taken one step further. One can now
        -:  444:use $ to escape any operator in a pattern, so that the otherwise problematic

        -:  446:
        -:  447:   23 August 2011
        -:  448:Inside macros the $ can be used as escape operator to insert a $ with empty
        -:  449:lhs in the evaluated macro. Also, the _ operator is from now on left untouched
        -:  450:in a macro unless escaped. This made it necessary to adapt a few bracmat

        -:  501:Arithmetic more complex than adding is now done with much higher radix.
        -:  502:For small numbers compuations are a little bit slower, because of conversions

        -:  513:    21 February 2011
        -:  514:Rewrite of bmalloc, bfree and initialization of memory. Memory now expands

        -:  520:    11 January 2011
        -:  521:The @ is again removed from non-nil atoms. Reason: the @ flag is used on a

        -:  536:In stringmatch, the % can be used to force characterwise matching if the

        -:  552:and no danger of stack overflow.
        -:  553:For short sums, the implementation has become a little bit slower, because

        -:  557:    8 November 2010
        -:  558:Made some minor changes such as int -> size_t.
        -:  559:Most radical change is introduction of function Entry2 which is like Entry,

        -:  575:In bmalloc, all bytes are set to 0, not just the last one.
        -:  576:Reason: if all elements of size X are in use, bmalloc may return

        -: 1103:NOTES
        -: 1104:=====
        -: 1105:
        -: 1106:2002.12.15
        -: 1107:----------
        -: 1108:This is the open source version of Bracmat.
        -: 1109:
        -: 1110:Originally, Bracmat was written in Basic for the Amstrad computer. Its sole
        -: 1111:purpose was to derive a simple expression for the curvature of a model
        -: 1112:space-time, starting from the components of the metric. The only operations
        -: 1113:the program was capable to perform were multiplications, exponentiations,
        -: 1114:logarithms, and partial derivatives. The expressions were a mix of numbers
        -: 1115:and symbolic variables, like "a+2*b". Thus, "a+a" was simplified to "2*a".
        -: 1116:
        -: 1117:The second version of Bracmat, about 1988, was developed in Ansi C and run
        -: 1118:on an Acorn Archimedes. Great care was taken to make the program portable to
        -: 1119:other hardware, such as Atari, VAX and even the PC. The PC architecture, with
        -: 1120:its limited memory, its 16 bit architecture and its limitation on the size of
        -: 1121:the program stack, posed some severe limitations on the program. Therefore
        -: 1122:great care was taken to limit the use of the stack to a minimum. This has
        -: 1123:lead to some rather large functions (to save stack-consuming function calls).
        -: 1124:
        -: 1125:The C version became a true programnming language, with program variables,
        -: 1126:logical operators and function calls. The syntax, however, was not changed.
        -: 1127:For example, instead of using "if...then...else...", I decided to write
        -: 1128:something like "...&...|...", using lazy evaluation of the infix binary
        -: 1129:logical operators "&" (AND) and "|" (OR) for program control.
        -: 1130:
        -: 1131:The logical operators, of course, should test for operands being "true" or
        -: 1132:"false". The main provider of interesting truth values became the pattern
        -: 1133:matching operator ":", which tests whether the pattern (the rhs-operand)
        -: 1134:matches the subject (the lhs-operand). The single outstanding feature of
        -: 1135:Bracmat is, in fact, its pattern recognition, which works on tree structures,
        -: 1136:not on strings of characters.
        -: 1137:
        -: 1138:Bracmat was also extended with a few operators that makes this programming
        -: 1139:language interesting in the field of computational linguistics, namely the
        -: 1140:blank " ", the comma "," and the full stop ".". (The interpunction symbols
        -: 1141:"?", "!" and ";" were already 'taken' to serve other purposes.)
        -: 1142:
        -: 1143:You may find the source code difficult to read at some places. You are best
        -: 1144:off if you understand English and Dutch (and perhaps Danish). Only if the
