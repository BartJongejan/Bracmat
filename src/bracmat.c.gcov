        -:   27:
        -:   28:If you can compile successfully but cannot run the program succesfully,
        -:   29:try putting -DBIGENDIAN on the command line of the compiler.
        -:   30:This works of course only if the machine's hardware is big-endian.
        -:   31:
        -:   32:The program only utilizes standard libraries.
        -:   33:
        -:   34:Until 2012, the source code consisted of a single file, bracmat.c.
        -:   35:Because XML is becoming more popular, a separate source file, xml.c

        -:  112:
        -:  113:    19 September 2012

        -:  116:Handling of two levels of indirection is improved generally.

        -:  131:    : (=(A&X:?(G1.)) B)
        -:  132:    )
        -:  133:would not match the 'B' in the pattern with anything valid, because the 
        -:  134:assignment X:?(G1.) had deleted the original subject. Now the subject is
        -:  135:temporarily reference-incremented, so the 'B' still matches the old value of
        -:  136:G1. The expression as a whole evaluates to X. Notice that this bug did not
        -:  137:affect the very similar
        -:  138:    ( (G2==A B)
        -:  139:    & !G2

        -:  142:Reason: here, the subject is not the object that G1 is bound to, but a copy.
        -:  143:And that is so because the object that G1 is bound to is headed by an
        -:  144:unevaluated = (being part of the rhs of an = operator). The expression !G2,
        -:  145:however, must be evaluated, so it cannot be identical to G2's value.
        -:  146:Consequently, the reassignment of G2 does not affect the subject of the
        -:  147:pattern match operation, which is (=A B) at all times.

        -:  154:greater than 509, which ISO C89 compilers are required to support. Therefore
        -:  155:the option -std=c99 is added.

        -:  165:Changes in bmalloc that makes it possible to compile with -O3.

        -:  215:
        -:  216:When Bracmat reads a file that is not well-formed, it asks fo a file name where

        -:  224:    4 February 2012

        -:  250:    20 January 2012

        -:  252:The previous change moved the scanning pointer to the point in the subject
        -:  253:where the rhs pattern starts. The current change moves the end of the
        -:  254:subject as far as necessary to the right to allow a full match of the rhs
        -:  255:pattern with last characters of the subject. Of course, this is only possible
        -:  256:if the final zero byte has not been reached. The calling instance of
        -:  257:stringmatch defines the end of the subject for the called instance. The called
        -:  258:instance can propose to move the end. In this way, scanning can move much
        -:  259:faster if a patterns contains some fixed strings. Speed-up does not work for
        -:  260:alternations of fixed srings. Speed-up only works for the first pattern
        -:  261:in a series of patterns connected by :

        -:  263:    7 January 2012
        -:  264:
        -:  265:If an non-initial part of a stringpattern is a string, then the scanning
        -:  266:pointer jumps to the first (or next) occurrence in the subject string after
        -:  267:the first mismatch.
        -:  268:
        -:  269:This changes the behaviour of some patterns, such as in
        -:  270:@(abXk:(|? b|`) X ?id)
        -:  271:Before, the match failed, because the 'b' in the pattern did not match the
        -:  272:'a' in the subject. Now, nowing that the first X occurs in the third position,
        -:  273:the pattern matcher not even tries to match 'a' and 'b' and so the expression
        -:  274:succeeds. In many cases the (|? b|`) pattern works as before, though:
        -:  275:@(abXk:(|? b|`) (X|Y) ?id)
        -:  276:@(abXk:(|? b|`) () X ?id)    dangerous! Does not work in @(ab:(|? b|`) ())

        -:  279:@(abXk:(|? b|`) !x ?id)
        -:  280:
        -:  281:It is not advisable to use this pattern anymore. It is too much dependent on

        -:  285:
        -:  286:Compiled 64 bit version with VS 2008. Had to use _WIN64 and some #defines,
        -:  287:because longs are 32 bit under VS 2008, whereas longs under gcc are 64 bits.
        -:  288:Also used the 64 bit versions of ftell and fseek in the VS 2008 case.

        -:  295:
        -:  296:Impression is that the 32 bit version should be used unless you have to deal

        -:  300:Otherwise, the 64 bit version is significantly slower and has almost three

        -:  303:    2 January 2012
        -:  304:
        -:  305:Made stringmatch 'greedy' to an extend that does not change the program's
        -:  306:behaviour. (That is: all tests in valid.bra go through). Many string
        -:  307:comparisons now continue past the cutoff position deviding the subject in a

        -:  313:
        -:  314:The normal (non-string) match is not optimized. It is questionable whether that

        -:  326:    16 December 2011
        -:  327:
        -:  328:Repaired two bugs in doPosition. The first bug made the FENCE flag disappear
        -:  329:from the result if the program was built in debug mode in VS2008, which made
        -:  330:the program run as expected, the other bug was that the FENCE flag was

        -:  339:
        -:  340:Introduced lambda. Syntax similar to macro.

        -:  365:    3 November 2011
        -:  366:
        -:  367:Nicified find and getmember calls, collapsing the last three arguments into

        -:  370:    2 November 2011
        -:  371:
        -:  372:Made better sense of [<> (equivalent to [~) and [~<> (equivalent to [).
        -:  373:Introduced [% prefix. The expression reigned by [% in a pattern is evaluated.
        -:  374:The success or failure of the expression is the result of the match.
        -:  375:This functionality is similar to patterns that are function calls: in both
        -:  376:cases the current subject is stored in a local variable sjt. In contrast to

        -:  381:    1 November 2011
        -:  382:
        -:  383:Changed signature of find, getmember, naamwoord and naamwoord_w. Before, these
        -:  384:functions returned TRUE or FALSE, while the binding was returned in a
        -:  385:pointer-to-a-pointer. The program is a bit quicker (approx. 5%).

        -:  396:After a change in handling the pattern ?^? (20100806) the function fct didn't

        -:  398:Also changed sub so it cannot go in infinite regress.

        -:  408:    2 September 2011
        -:  409:
        -:  410:Corrected error in evalmacro. Inserted operator nodes where deemed to fail

        -:  414:
        -:  415:The escape operator ()$ in patterns can now be used to test for flags on the
        -:  416:subject. A special case is when the rhs is an empty atom with no flags. This
        -:  417:pattern only matches subjects with no flags. In all other cases, if one or
        -:  418:more flags are present in the rhs, the subject must have these flags as well,

        -:  420:
        -:  421:If the rhs is an atomic node with a non-empty string, the rhs can only match
        -:  422:atomic subjects with the same string. (But possibly with flags that are not

        -:  425:   29 August 2011
        -:  426:
        -:  427:The use of $ as "escape operator" is now taken one step further. One can now
        -:  428:use $ to escape any operator in a pattern, so that the otherwise problematic
        -:  429:operators = | & : ' $ _ can be pacified and parsed.
        -:  430:
        -:  431:   23 August 2011
        -:  432:Inside macros the $ can be used as escape operator to insert a $ with empty
        -:  433:lhs in the evaluated macro. Also, the _ operator is from now on left untouched
        -:  434:in a macro unless escaped. This made it necessary to adapt a few bracmat
        -:  435:scripts, e.g. the cat$ function in this file.

        -:  437:   19 August 2011
        -:  438:

        -:  442:
        -:  443:   26 July 2011
        -:  444:There was a problem with the ! and !! flags in connection with the flg

        -:  446:in the result (=!.a) of the evaluation of flg$(=!a), the element ! had the
        -:  447:READY flag set. Now the '!' has the READY flag unset, while the 'a' has it set.
        -:  448:
        -:  449:   29 June 2011
        -:  450:Changed a few ints to long to get rid of type casts.
        -:  451:
        -:  452:   21 June 2011
        -:  453:Converted this source code to UTF-8.

        -:  455:    5 May 2011
        -:  456:The expression ((==.lst$its).)' tried to list an object that was gone.
        -:  457:Now it works. The listed object is =.lst$its
        -:  458:Notice how recursion can be implemented with a 'lambda method' that has access

        -:  466:An expression like (x=!x)&!x now results in an endless loop, not a stack

        -:  468:
        -:  469:    31 March 2011
        -:  470:Stackoverflow occurred if an uninitialised variable was assigned to the

        -:  485:Arithmetic more complex than adding is now done with much higher radix.
        -:  486:For small numbers compuations are a little bit slower, because of conversions
        -:  487:to and from character strings. For large numbers, timings are magnitudes

        -:  497:    21 February 2011
        -:  498:Rewrite of bmalloc, bfree and initialization of memory. Memory now expands
        -:  499:dynamically: when a there are no more free memory blocks of 1,2 or 3 (4, 5, 6)
        -:  500:words available, a new pool of memory blocks for the depleted size is created,
        -:  501:doubling the number of blocks in the already allocated pools for that size.
        -:  502:Removed a bug that caused (a=7)&!(a*1) to fail.

        -:  504:    11 January 2011
        -:  505:The @ is again removed from non-nil atoms. Reason: the @ flag is used on a 
        -:  506:non-nil atom to indicate that backslashes in the atomstring must be
        -:  507:interpreted litterally, i.e. @"d:\bracmat" is equivalent to "d:\\bracmat"

        -:  519:    22 November 2010
        -:  520:In stringmatch, the % can be used to force characterwise matching if the
        -:  521:pattern is a number. For that reason, the % and @ are no longer removed from
        -:  522:non-nil atoms as superfluous.
        -:  523:One has to take care with minusses: the patterns %"-20/5" and %-20/5 are
        -:  524:different. In %"-20/5", the % is superfluous and the pattern matches
        -:  525:characterwise. In %-20/5, the pattern matches 20/5 and the minus is ignored!
        -:  526:
        -:  527:    19 November 2010
        -:  528:Some tests to check that the position flag is followed by an integer number

        -:  530:Made sure that mod$ and div$ fail if second argument is zero.
        -:  531:
        -:  532:    15 November 2010
        -:  533:Evaluation of sums and products is now iterative instead of recursive.
        -:  534:Also, two sums or products are neatly merged instead of appended and thereafter
        -:  535:bubble sorted. Result: much faster processing of very large sums and products
        -:  536:and no danger of stack overflow.
        -:  537:For short sums, the implementation has become a little bit slower, because
        -:  538:I reverted to older, but simpler code that makes more allocations and

        -:  540:
        -:  541:    8 November 2010
        -:  542:Made some minor changes such as int -> size_t.
        -:  543:Most radical change is introduction of function Entry2 which is like Entry,
        -:  544:only with lower level of indirection. Entry2 replaces Entry in three places.

        -:  546:    3 November 2010
        -:  547:Improved percolation of filter flags < > # / @ %
        -:  548:
        -:  549:    1 November 2010
        -:  550:The built-in function now returns IMPLIEDFENCE if the subject string in
        -:  551:a stringmatch is too long or if it cannot be grown to a valid UTF-8
        -:  552:multibyte sequence. Previously, the FENCE flag was set, but this had
        -:  553:the side effect that utf$ couldn't easily be used as the lhs of a match.
        -:  554:
        -:  555:Change to flt$ : flt$(0,...) now returns 0 instead of failing. Replaced

        -:  558:    27 October 2010
        -:  559:In bmalloc, all bytes are set to 0, not just the last one.
        -:  560:Reason: if all elements of size X are in use, bmalloc may return
        -:  561:a bigger sized element, of which the last four bytes will not be
        -:  562:used at all. Instead, some earlier bytes must be set to 0.

        -:  568:The function expandProduct turned off the READY flag on all processed output,
        -:  569:even if the result was atomic and therefore ready.
        -:  570:Consequence: (1+i)*(1+-i) was evaluated to non-ready value 2, which could

        -: 1087:NOTES
        -: 1088:=====
        -: 1089:
        -: 1090:2002.12.15
        -: 1091:----------
        -: 1092:This is the open source version of Bracmat.
        -: 1093:
        -: 1094:Originally, Bracmat was written in Basic for the Amstrad computer. Its sole
        -: 1095:purpose was to derive a simple expression for the curvature of a model
        -: 1096:space-time, starting from the components of the metric. The only operations
        -: 1097:the program was capable to perform were multiplications, exponentiations,
        -: 1098:logarithms, and partial derivatives. The expressions were a mix of numbers
        -: 1099:and symbolic variables, like "a+2*b". Thus, "a+a" was simplified to "2*a".
        -: 1100:
        -: 1101:The second version of Bracmat, about 1988, was developed in Ansi C and run
        -: 1102:on an Acorn Archimedes. Great care was taken to make the program portable to
        -: 1103:other hardware, such as Atari, VAX and even the PC. The PC architecture, with
        -: 1104:its limited memory, its 16 bit architecture and its limitation on the size of
        -: 1105:the program stack, posed some severe limitations on the program. Therefore
        -: 1106:great care was taken to limit the use of the stack to a minimum. This has
        -: 1107:lead to some rather large functions (to save stack-consuming function calls).
        -: 1108:
        -: 1109:The C version became a true programnming language, with program variables,
        -: 1110:logical operators and function calls. The syntax, however, was not changed.
        -: 1111:For example, instead of using "if...then...else...", I decided to write
        -: 1112:something like "...&...|...", using lazy evaluation of the infix binary
        -: 1113:logical operators "&" (AND) and "|" (OR) for program control.
        -: 1114:
        -: 1115:The logical operators, of course, should test for operands being "true" or
        -: 1116:"false". The main provider of interesting truth values became the pattern
        -: 1117:matching operator ":", which tests whether the pattern (the rhs-operand)
        -: 1118:matches the subject (the lhs-operand). The single outstanding feature of
        -: 1119:Bracmat is, in fact, its pattern recognition, which works on tree structures,
        -: 1120:not on strings of characters.
        -: 1121:
        -: 1122:Bracmat was also extended with a few operators that makes this programming
        -: 1123:language interesting in the field of computational linguistics, namely the
        -: 1124:blank " ", the comma "," and the full stop ".". (The interpunction symbols
        -: 1125:"?", "!" and ";" were already 'taken' to serve other purposes.)

        -: 1127:You may find the source code difficult to read at some places. You are best
        -: 1128:off if you understand English and Dutch (and perhaps Danish). Only if the
